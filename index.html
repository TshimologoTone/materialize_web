    <h3>Location : Cape Town</h3>
    I believe everyone born outside of the Western Cape, travelling to Cape Town is their desire simply because of what we were able to hear about the city. I genuinely want to experience the beach, the weather, the beautiful things that the city has to offer and ultimately experience the climate of the city.
